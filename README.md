# Dune Combat Calculator

This tool for Gale Force Nine's Dune board game is used to calculate the strength of your forces in battle when using the advanced combat rules, which require spice to be paid in order for your forces to contribute their full strength.
It can also be used as a completely digital battlewheel.

To use it, choose your faction and these fields will appear:

+ **Forces.** Use this field to indicate how many force tokens you will commit to the battle. Win or lose, these forces will die.
+ **Spice.** Use this field to indicate how much spice you will pay to increase the strength of your forces.
+ **Dialed Strength** (Read only). This is the resulting strength calculated using the forces and spice fields.
+ **Total Strength** (Read only). This will be the total battle strength when you have chosen a leader.
+ **Leader Field** Click this button to choose a leader from the faction.

If you play as the Emperor, the Fremen, or the Ixians, you will have special forces (Sardaukar, Fedaykin, and Cyborgs, respectively). In these cases, the Forces field will be renamed **Ordinary Forces**, and a new field will appear for you to commit your special forces.

After selecting a leader (Or a cheap hero) the strength of that leader will get added to the total.
Another button to kill the selected leader will also appear. It will just show a killed leader and substract the leader-value from the total.

When selecting Harkonnen, you get the option to select one of your captured leaders. Simply push the button, select the faction you kidnapped the leader from, then select the leader.

Also after selecting a leader these two fields will appear:

+ **Weapon** Choose a weapon for this battle.
+ **Defense** Choose a defense for this battle.

Depending on your choices, the matching symbols and text will appear above.

## Karama'ing Starred Tokens

The calculator does not have an option to "Karama" the starred tokens of the Emperor and the Fremen and force them to count as ordinary forces. If you are Karama'ed in this way, simply dial your battle plan as if all the tokens in the territory were "Ordinary Forces".

There is, however, an option for when the Fremen are Karama'ed and forced to pay spice support. Simply tick the "Spice Support" checkbox and the Spice field will appear.
