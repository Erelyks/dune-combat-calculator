# Dune Combat Calculator

This tool for Gale Force Nine's Dune board game is used to calculate the strength of your forces in battle when using the advanced combat rules, which require spice to be paid in order for your forces to contribute their full strength.

To use it, choose your faction and three fields will appear:

+ **Forces.** Use this field to indicate how many force tokens you will commit to the battle. Win or lose, these forces will die.
+ **Spice.** Use this field to indicate how much spice you will pay to increase the strength of your forces.
+ **Strength.** Read only. This is the resulting strength calculated using the other two fields. Dial this number on the battle wheel.

If you play as the Emperor, the Fremen, or the Ixians, you will have special forces (Sardaukar, Fedaykin, and Cyborgs, respectively). In these cases, the Forces field will be renamed **Ordinary Forces**, and a new field will appear for you to commit your special forces.uerza" en la rueda de batalla, o usar tu dispositivo con esta herramienta *en lugar* de la rueda de batalla.

## Karama'ing Starred Tokens

The calculator does not have an option to "Karama" the starred tokens of the Emperor and the Fremen and force them to count as ordinary forces. If you are Karama'ed in this way, simply dial your battle plan as if all the tokens in the territory were "Ordinary Forces".

There is, however, an option for when the Fremen are Karama'ed and forced to pay spice support. Simply tick the "Spice Support" checkbox and the Spice field will appear.

## Future Plans

I plan to revisit this calculator in my free time, and I have thought of the possibility of adding things, namely the possibility of including Treachery Cards and Leaders, making it so that the game's battle wheels can be entirely replaced with this tool.
